# CC-Tweaked-Image-Scroll

A script to run on an advanced computer connected to an array of advanced monitors. The three nfp files for the images can be changed to whatever you name your paint files in the computer. The value after sleep can be changed to add more delay, and the chunk of code for one image is repeatable for personal use.

If the monitors are an odd shape for the paint command, run "monitor (direction) paint (name for slide)".
Unfortunately, the painting is done by hand either way.
